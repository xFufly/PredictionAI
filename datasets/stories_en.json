        "content": "a cold wind blew hard over the brittle surface of the faltering world that morning the arthritic sun rose slowly to claim its rightful place in the pale, stretched sky its thin, sallow light bled meekly through the grey and impotent clouds already you could tell it was going to be another brutal, callous day somewhere beneath the bitter sky a dog barked wildly, blinded by the same old urges and primal suspicions that had always ruled its heart the hollowing wind pulled at the shambolic remains of houses scattered alongside the roadside it plucked tiles from their rooftops and blew clusters of litter into slow, meandering dances that followed the faces of the crumbling curbs until it was done with them swirling newspaper pages and torn food wrappers rolling empty beer cans and crushed cigarette butts spent shell casings all of them moved together in drunken, giddy, brief dalliances two figures walked slowly along this broken road two men two thieves the sound of their boots rang out a tired, if purposeful tattoo on the cracked surface as they went they kept on looking dead ahead, bristling with adrenaline and anticipation they were focused on their destination and the task at hand look, the younger one was saying, carrying his prized rifle out in his hands for all the world to see were done talking about this the plan is simple for a reason its staying that way sure the older one kept a cigarette held between his cracked lips simple the older thief, for his sins, tried to leave his pistol sitting in its holster until he absolutely needed it he liked the idea that some days he might not even need it at all of course, there were still the black days when it took all of his willpower to force himself to put it back there again days when red mist fells days when it felt as if every man left in this world was trying to test him still, there was some desperate and overstretched part of himself that always had a say in the matter the side of him that didnt used to carry a gun the side of him that remembered who hed used to be when the world was whole the part of him still said all of this was wrong it was convinced that if the gun stayed by his side then maybe others would pay him the same kindness although these days he was beginning to worry hed just created another superstition to live his life by you could drown in your private superstitions out here if you werent careful he took the spent nub of the cigarette from between his lips and tossed it back over his shoulder the acrid taste of the first smoke of the day felt necessary if not necessarily good the dog end smouldered and died as it was left in their wake ash crumbled to the ground another breadcrumb to mark out their passage through this dying world on the way here they had passed so many burnt out skeletons of homes so many ransacked ruins they had seen overgrown gardens reclaimed and clawed back by the strong hands of nature fallen, bullet ridden fences stone boundary walls built up and fortified with rusting barbed wire and concrete blocks they had seen rusting land mines surrounding farm crops and bodies left hanging in the trees as reminders of the new laws the fall had clearly hit hard around here the two thieves had remarked on it when theyd first entered this county the younger thief had reckoned it was something to do with it being so close to the ocean his parents had told him years ago that the sea always made men feel small and made them act funny if they stared at it for too long the older thief hadnt said much on the matter he knew that it didnt take a close proximity to water to force men to commit horrifying acts especially these days although some men had never needed an excuse his own father had taught him that look, theres nothing to worry about, the younger one said, his eyes cruel and hungry as he surveyed the land ahead of them the plan is solid he had shaved all his ginger hair off a long time ago and he never let it grow back this was his new face that was how he liked to think of it stripped down, sharp and savage he didnt like his old face anymore he didnt even like seeing photos of it it reminded him of a life he no longer had any claim to he had done terrible things since those photos had been taken terrible things that this pale face dappled with rough, red scree suited well it looked quiet yesterday, didnt it he carried on he spat on the decaying body of a dead bird as they passed it by it looked downright lonely to me everywhere looks lonely now, said the older thief doesnt mean its safe the younger thief shook his head a dark smile on his lips sometimes i dont know how you survived this long you ask me, youre getting afraid of your own shadow his slightly heavy set companion shrugged it looked like an action of deflation the smile on his face was little more than a narrow, uncertain crease in my defence my shadow does carry a gun look, weve been out here long enough to know that were not running into any armed patrols not like last time this is just another little place in the middle of nowhere well, i dont know about you but i dont fancy getting shot in the middle of nowhere all im saying is that the plan is simple because it doesnt need to be complicated this job looks easy the last one looked easy the older thief felt all too aware of the weight of the gun resting on his hip look where that got us the last job had ended ragged and badly and fast they had walked into a large food store, guns out and shouting for cooperation, only to find themselves staring at an armed squad of marshals stocking up for a patrol the fight had been short lived and there had been a lot more running away than holding ground on the part of the thieves until that day there had always been a third thief who travelled with them, but they had been forced to leave him behind after he was shot later they had perched on a low rise and watched as the marshals burnt his body they had left his ashes to blow away on the wind without saying any sort of prayer for him the marshals had held their god fearing tongues out of disdain for him, whilst the two thieves hadnt dared breath a word to try and save their own sorry skins that was a long way from here, the younger thief said, his eyes fixed on the horizon and ive apologised every step of the way all that apologising has made me hungry along with all that running the younger thiefs fingers clutched a little tighter at his rifle he hoped his partner didnt see in the same way, he hoped his partner had never seen his fear on his face on that day when the marshals had drawn on them they had acted pretty much as one they had moved like a swarm of something they never seemed to blink theyd even breathed in unison and theyd shot as one the sound of it in that tin pot shed of a store had been deafening it was like hearing thunder up close hed spent every night since then waking to the sound of those gunshots still ringing in his ears, always with the distinct feeling that hed been shot to this day, hed been unable to forgive himself for the fact hed flinched when theyd fired that first volley flinched closed his eyes convinced himself that he was done that single moment had seemed to last a colourless and endless eternity well, hows this i come in there with you no the younger one shook his head curtly you need to be outside, keeping watch i dont want anyone walking in this is best way to do it with just the two of us i go in and you keep watch we both know that youre the better lookout by a mile i still dont like it, the older one said squarely i dont like you going in there by yourself and i dont like me standing out there on my own splitting up is asking for trouble look, were a man down we have to do things differently the older thief tried to fit the idea into his head but it still wouldnt take no sorry i dont like you going in there alone why not youre twitchy im not twitchy im fine sure, youre fine youre starving hungry, youre not sleeping properly and youre not thinking straight sounds fine to me the older thief was wearing a wide brimmed hat crammed down over his lank, long hair it kept the straining glare of the sun out of his eyes a few greasy looking strands of his greying fringe were forever getting loose and blowing across his dark eyes he never flinched or tried to fuss them away he didnt see the point he wore his beard as long and unkempt as his hair he hid his face whereas his young friend kept his exposed for all the world to see dont fuss at me im sleeping fine im eating my rations im in control his fingers gripped tighter at the rifle again sure you are his older partner didnt even try to sound convinced look, i have to go in there, alright i can read people better than you i know when theyre holding out on me and im not afraid to ask a little harder if i think they are whereas you, youre too nice the crease of a smile wavered its been a long time since anyone called me nice his voice faltered, unsure whether it was a compliment or an insult even with all the debating, they never stopped walking the pull of the hunger was too strong in both of them now their boots crunched over the dead ground as they walked on, closer and closer to that small shop and the vague hope of finding real food the cold air bled through any gap it could find in their worn, battered clothing they had been working on this job since they had passed the place early yesterday morning, heading in the opposite direction they hadnt been looking for work but this seemed to be good to be true it was under their skin now another itch that had to be scratched youd go in there and feel bad for them, the younger thief pointed out youd take pity on them and leave them with something and whats wrong with that everything his eyes burned well, im still not convinced if i need you, ill call okay and if you need me you just start shooting ill come running the older thief looked behind them the road seemed to stretch back a long way it hadnt felt like theyd walked that far this morning their desolate little camp from last night had to be a good few miles back now theyd stayed out of the town but made sure to keep it in their sights, just in case there was any trouble brewing round here not that distance was any guarantee in the same way a plan wasnt any sort of insurance his hand twitched over his gun but he stopped himself no point tempting fate just yet if im staying outside then i should get the rifle not a chance the rifle is mine it stays with me then any fight that comes at us is going to have to come pretty close before i can do anything about it fine with me brave words for the man with the rifle i seriously dont know what youre worrying about do you really see anyone around here putting up much of a fight the older thief shrugged i just dont feel a powerful urge to jinx us thats all he knew only too well that food was scarce out here, in the dead and crumbling regions robbing a store like this was tantamount to killing a whole struggling town he also knew how hungry he was and that his partner was even hungrier so they needed to eat, regardless of how others around here coped from day to day after they were gone that was just how the world worked now for every man, everywhere it was no longer your business to care about any man but yourself if you tried to live any other way you would die unless, maybe, you were one of the men who huddled together in the big cities all they did all day was pray, whip themselves and empty their seed into a paper cup, shedding a tear for all the women and children they had ever loved whilst they did it that was what earned you sanctuary these days a clean record, a clean medical test, a willingness to give samples and a totally gullible soul a blind sense of self righteousness also helped like those fools wouldnt die in the end anyway, same as every other men the lifeboats would come back for them all soon enough there was nothing that really separated them from all those women and children theyd buried or burnt a few years ago it was all just a matter of time now and how you chose to spend it there were so many men out there now hunting for a distraction or playing at being something else they changed their names and cut themselves, they pretended they were a totally different animal without a governing hand or any sort of hope in sight this world had become a bad reflection of the place it once was here we go finally there it was their destination visible now and getting closer with every step not that either of them broke into a run they took their time, kept themselves under control their scavenger eyes scanning the land for signs of trouble a large, empty car park sat in front of the small row of shops, its surface as cracked and ruined as the road that led up to it there were only a few vacant heaps of rust and some flat tyres left scattered across its web of empty spaces now there were a few old dark burn marks on the tarmac shadows with nothing to cast them in the sunlight men had clearly camped here at some point most of the shops themselves were derelicts, uninhabited husks, but there at the centre was the jewel in the crown and it was still unguarded by the looks of it the older one had been surprised at how few customers theyd seen go in there yesterday but his younger companion had sneered and said he reckoned not many locals would venture this far out anymore he reasoned they were more likely to be the kind of men who spent their days building little tokens to help their crops grow better and mending their fences still looks good to me the greed was all too clear in his voice he stopped and turned to face the car park and the shop beyond he licked his lips and ran a hand along his rifle his fathers old rifle hed learned to hunt with this gun he felt his stomach start to burn it was a familiar pain part of the routine these days his body was sharpening itself up for what lay ahead his yellowed eyes looked at the flat, barren world around him and the shop ahead of him like it was all just another target another little kingdom for the taking his travelling companion and partner in crime stared past his greasy tangles of grey hair and ran a hand through his dry, wiry beard he felt sick he always did just before about they robbed a place maybe it was because he could always find some trace evidence of his old life in these moments the battered, faded sales signs in the window the open sign on the door the posters advertising new movies for rent adverts for fireworks, discount alcohol and lottery tickets sometimes youd walk through a door like that with a gun in your hand and a little bell would ring over your head it would make you stop for a moment it was such a simple little sound, but it was ghostly now it was haunted a shiver would run down your spine when you heard it only that bell no longer summoned a smiling face to greet or serve you no, now it brought covering fire, pleas for mercy and occasional bloodshed he still couldnt work out why some men felt driven to keep these places open, stocking them with whatever they could it couldnt just be about making money or building any sort of an empire any more maybe it was more about helping the community or maybe it was simply yet another way to occupy themselves and pass the time or maybe it was some lingering form of duty, muscle memory of a former life something they had always done a reason to get out of bed in the morning there was a lot of that delusion going around a couple of weeks back the two thieves had walked along a deserted stretch of motorway it had been a risk but they wanted to travel quickly motorways werent always easy to negotiate now it wasnt just a case of all the abandoned cars and dead bodies there was always the chance of running into someone far worse than yourself still they were quicker than cutting through smaller towns, near patrols of marshals and local militia it was down this particular stretch of four lane road that they had passed a guy washing abandoned cars there was no real reason for him to be there it was just how he chose to spend his days they had seen men pursue stranger options after all although there was something tragic about that man, with his bucket of murky water and mouldering sponge the dim smile of satisfaction on his bruised and haggard face one hand little more than a stump he walked badly, dragging an infected leg behind him he only had one working eye but the other hadnt been removed it was still there, hanging loose against his cheek not that it seemed to bother him probably the work of raiders for all the pain he must have felt he kept on cleaning those broken down and abandoned cars, always smiling to himself it was a toothless, vacant smile of childish bliss the older thief had watched him and wondered if it would be easier to just let go like that let the madness in his travelling companion had felt differently he had shot the fool in the head and taken what he could use from his cart which hadnt been a lot survival had never been a pretty word but the world had changed it into something else now something fouler, something more incendiary it could spark flames any second now survival was a far more dangerous word than it used to be men held it too close to their hearts it was a motto, a creed an alibi maybe even a religion of sorts survival was spelt with a lot more blood than it used to be and the older thief was certain the nature of it had changed it was no longer the survival of the fittest no, now it was the survival of the keenest were vultures, he said, the thought slipping past his tired defences the younger one turned his head and smiled like hed just gotten some joke hed heard years ago careful thats a dirty word around here the wind whipped at them the older one could feel his heart starting to race his blood pumping harder he could taste the sharp metal tang of adrenaline rising at the back of his throat he looked at the hungry face of his partner any job before now and the boy would never have offered to go in there alone back then, of course, theyd had a third man with them a good, steadying influence on the boy a big man with a slow, strong way of speaking he never panicked he never looked worried he rarely even raised an eyebrow he looked over the devastation and always saw some new way for them to survive he had been as steady as a rock, right up until the moment those marshals had blown his knee apart with a shotgun the older thief felt a straying hand brush against the pistol hanging at his hip he could feel himself trying to push away from the world, trying step clear of his skin until this was done he was never truly in control of himself once the gun was drawn his partner read the action and nodded curtly he started to head for the shop, marching across the deserted car park the older thief stood and watched him go for a few steps before he walked towards the remains of the low wall that ran along the end of the car park he planted himself behind it he spat on the dead grass and pulled his hat a little lower, so the brim was nearly over his eyes at times like this his old life would always bleed through whether he wanted it to or not he couldnt stop the ghost of his wife singing softly in his ear, as subtle as a regrettable thought it wasnt what he needed to hear right now but she would always turn up she used to sing to herself when she cooked but she would always stop if he walked in if he ever heard her start he would stand in their small dining room and listen for a while, smiling to himself he tried to distract himself from the ghost of her breathing down his neck he listened to the footfalls of his partner as he strode over to the little shop instead he counted them as he went twenty one twenty two twenty three he wasnt rushing maybe that was a good sign he fought to control the hunger in his stomach as he listened he had seen so many good men fall to the hunger over these past ten years he had seen them run into fires to raid the flames for something to eat, something to drink he had seen men burn a friends corpse only for the smell to grow too much for them to bear this felt no different they were just running into their own kind of fire, picking at a different kind of corpse his hand strayed to his hip again as he surveyed the desolate road and the shells of the buildings around him no sign of movement the boots of his partner kept ringing out off the cracked tarmac of the car park he kept counting them thirty five thirty six thirty seven not a long way to run if there was any kind of trouble he hated to admit it but he did like the way the boy carried the rifle out in front of him at all times there was no pretence to the action it was a clear and simple declaration of intent i am armed and i am ready it was a rare thing these days a lot of men hid their weapons, old and the young alike the lifeboats had changed them it had stripped them down to something grim and gaunt the barest minimums required of humanity their bodies and their souls had become something to hang their clothes on in the mornings he checked the road in both directions nothing stirred smoke rose from a chimney stack back in town, but that was about it he pulled a pack of battered gum out of his pocket and crammed a slab of it between his jaws he started working on it the acid in his stomach rose and began to pitch a fit it would keep him sharp it would keep him keen and harsh until this was done the boy didnt look back as he slipped into the store his rifle raising as the door closed behind him his shouts were just audible for that moment, carried on the wind then the door closed and silence settled he didnt fire a warning shot another possible good omen the older thief surveyed the wrecked cars in front of the place six of them burnt out, gutted and left to rust no one would be sleeping in those theyd done a brief check yesterday but there were no sign of life all this silence made him wish he could explain away the cold surprise he could feel lurking in the air close by christ, how he was hungry he kept chewing on the gum not long, he told himself not long until we eat something other than dry rations he tried not to think about what the boy was doing in there or what he might find that rifle was heavy and fully loaded and the boy had good aim with it there was no doubt about that he liked to pretend he could only fight close up but the older thief knew where that came from he knew that his young companion liked to be close to his kills he liked to watch them die he liked to listen to them splutter out word around the town drunks last night was that this place was run by a couple of brothers old men they had already been old when everything went wrong, when the lifeboats had first reared its ugly head and the children had started to die old or ancient, the shop keepers age wouldnt cut them any slack with the man who had just walked in through their front door if they moved too slow or didnt hear too well it would cost them and that rifle barked pretty loud when it got angry he would know all about it out here the older thief shook the thought from his head and kept on watching the world around him no point fretting until something went wrong if something went wrong he stayed calm as calm as he could allow nothing stirred no sign to betray the coming of the storm he was so sure was out there, hiding around some sheltered corner although he always felt like this when they were working he couldnt allow himself to deny it or quieten it down that was tempting fate on a scale he couldnt face paranoia was best to be spoilt and fussed over at a time like this you didnt want it festering into any sort of reality because it felt left out he turned his attention to the other shops in the row nothing more than hollowed out faces now scalped skulls gravestones to a past that was never coming back a dry cleaners, a takeaway of some description, a hairdressers and a computer game place by the look of it jesus, how he missed fast food kung po chicken, pizza, fish and chips greasy kebab meat thai curries and fierce, fiery enchiladas all just a phone call or a short drive away once upon a time he had to fight to shut the taste of them out of his mouth food like that simply didnt exist anymore or, if it did, it would come at a high price they had ran into a bunch of raiders once who kept a chef prisoner they had him chained up in a wagon, preparing steaks and other treats the deal seemed to be when they got bored of his food they were going to make him start cooking pieces of himself another desperate life you could do nothing to help although those steaks had smelt damn good he worked harder at the gum and tried, yet again, to rein in the hunger when the kid came out of there he might have some fairly fresh bread or some tinned goods maybe some new dry ration food there wouldnt be much else, but it would do food was no longer a luxury or a hobby it wasnt an interest anymore it was fuel, plain and simple you ate or you starved he tried to think of something, anything to take his mind off the hunger he thought about the church theyd passed on the way to the town the ruined church with the tree growing out through the roof he couldnt shake that image for some reason it had stuck with him since hed first seen it the tree looked like it had punched right through the joists and tiles now dead leaves were falling off the branches and scattering over the remains of the roof tiles there had been crows on those branches or, at least, they were there when he remembered it now large, black shapes watching them pass by when the birds had screeched and cawed the older thief was sure hed heard some unspoken judgement or warning in their cries his eyes were cold and focused now he let his eyes stray to the door his partner had gone through only moments ago it felt longer than it actually was time played tricks on you when you were working, when you were waiting it refused to obey the simple tick of a clock there was still no movement, still no sound nothing which had to be good still, though, he kept his left hand over the gun resting on his hip he hated waiting it never sat well with him the wind blew up again and his loose tangles of grey hair moved with it he didnt blink or fuss them away he just kept staring at the door he ran through scenarios that he was desperate to avoid it felt less like ticking them off and more like stopping them before they could catch him off guard he cast an eye back at the town, just to make sure nothing was happening back there either it was a real rubble and dirt kind of place nothing more than a ruin in the making another shambolic footnote to the world that was another festering knot of the fearful, the god botherers and the ever grieving maybe the kid had been right maybe there wouldnt be any trouble here they had gone into town for a drink in last night the men in there, lit by fading candles, had already started to look like corpses the first gunshot snapped him to full attention his left hand twitched over his hip and the gun was in his grip he spat the gum out he was heading across the car park fast, before he even thought about what he was doing he moved quicker than it looked like his older frame should allow his boots drove him across the jigsaw puzzle of faded borders that made up the empty parking spaces he sucked in air and tried to keep the adrenaline down to a controllable surge he pictured a sea of marshals waiting in there for him he saw them armed to the teeth he looked over his shoulder as he kept moving no one behind him the second gunshot made him speed up to a full pelt run his eyes focused on the shop door no one was coming out he couldnt hear raised voices he got to the ruined shop fronts that was when the third and fourth gunshots rang out the boys rifle he was sure of it that aggressive bark the rifle was alive and kicking he pressed against the wall and turned his back to the shop he studied the ruined, desolate horizon it still looked clear that had to count for something he moved along the wall, dragging his long coat against the rough face of the bricks he got right outside the shop still no movement from inside no more shots either the weight of the gun in his hand made him felt better but he knew it was a lie every gun told you although it felt good to be lied to right now sometimes you needed to believe you were just that little bit more invincible he kept the door to his left, his gun close to the door he looked around his chest heaving his hands shaking slightly the car park the road the fields beyond nothing moved whatever had happened in there didnt seem to be part of a trap in fact the whole world seemed to have fallen silent to the sound of that rifle he shook his left hand as he thought, the gun rattled in his grip he had to see what was going on in there there was no other choice he leant round fast, not giving himself time to think his heart was beating fast and hard, as if to prove it wasnt ready to stop yet he peered through the cracked glass, past the fractured reflection of his own tired face he could just see the dim outline of shelves and a skeleton crew of boxes and tins nothing else no signs of life he needed a better line of sight he needed to cause some alarm he pulled back against the wall, took a breath and held the gun up at the glass he pulled the trigger a crack of thunder filled his head and his hands the bitter crisp shatter of the glass sounded a million miles away he waited, his ears ringing he checked around him again still nothing good you in there he yelled through the broken glass, taking another fast look he could see through the dust kicked up by the shot there was no movement in there no sound every nerve in his body was telling him to run but he fought it all down, like stamping out fires he was hungry and sometimes the hunger had to win out if you were going to survive he gritted his teeth living alone out here was no way to live anyway i know you didnt call me but i heard shots silence he cursed under his breath im coming in he spun, grabbed the door handle with his free hand and went in at a stumbling gait grace had never been his strong suit he had stepped on his brides feet three times during their wedding day thats how graceful he was under pressure the shop was small and dark it was also damn near empty gun smoke hung heavy in the air a few museum piece tins and boxes sat on shelves liked the last children waiting to be collected from school you could smell the age and the neglect in here you could feel it bristling against your skin at his feet the older thief found a thin, stretched puddle of blood his eyes reluctantly followed it to the counter the boy was dead slumped on the ground at an awkward angle the rifle still clutched in his hands, blood trailing from his lips his pale eyes were frozen, wide open the remaining thief stepped towards him, keeping a watchful eye on the counter no movement there just a deep, hard spray of blood covering the wall behind it a couple of holes shot deep into the ageing plaster it looked like both had hit home, driving through meat and bone before planting themselves into the wall the boy had done well the thief took a glance over the counter at the two bodies both very old men older than you normally saw around these days they almost looked identical, even in death their bloated and flabby chests and backs had been blown open, like something had torn its way out of them their hearts taken flight near their bodies were a pair of small, simple handguns matching snub nosed, brass pistols he spat on them for their sins and tucked his gun back in its holster there was no threat here anymore his partner had seen to that with his dying breath and a strong aim there was nothing but corpses behind the counter now the bullets are turned them into fresh produce for the right kind of desperate monster who would soon come calling there were plenty of those around now another breed of vulture, although still not the one that most men feared the thief left them lying there and turned to his fallen partner he squatted next to the dead boy, looking briefly over the dirt and blood covered floor i told you the plan wouldnt work with two, he said in a low voice he immediately regretted the rebuke another graceless moment he bowed his aching head the adrenaline draining away and leaving a hangover of sorts in its place the boy had two holes in him wild shots one had struck lucky he wouldnt have felt much it was a hollow consolation i shouldnt have let you come in here alone this is my fault he took the dusty old hat off his old head and let his long, grey mop of hair fall loose over his face he sat it on a shelf and closed his own eyes for a moment he muttered something appropriate, if a little stale, and then opened his eyes again he made the gesture of the cross with his gun hand before pulling the rifle out of the dead boys grip hed forgotten how weighty the damn thing was he rested it against a nearby shelf and stood up off his haunches with a groan he cast an eye over the almost bare shop three dead for this it didnt seem right still no point wasting it, he figured, explaining his thinking to the dead hed have to watch that now he was alone he took the canvas bag off his partners unresisting shoulder and flipped it open he loaded it with as many cans as he could, not checking to see what they were the cold cut to his bones as he worked there were ghosts already brewing in this room he could feel them shifting into being he could feel them watching him closely a man has to eat, he said to no one in particular as he kept loading the bag he noticed a tin of fuel behind the counter ill finish this up, he thought, then ill burn this place to the ground he kept working he kept filling the bag he could easily sell what he didnt need and one mouth was going to be easier and cheaper to feed than two a silver lining, no matter how thin it was when the bag was nearly full he dropped a tin it rolled away from him the man stopped, breathless, overridden with greed he watched it lumber underneath a stack of shelves you could hear the food sloshing around inside it he looked at the door the faded posters over the walls promised foods he hadnt eaten in years this place felt like a tomb now he was grave robbing he looked down at the bag and felt his stomach churn run, it told him you dont need that one tin let it go only he couldnt his friend had died to get him in here leaving this one tin behind felt like blasphemy so he ignored the fear and the chill warnings rushing through his head slowly, he laid the bag down and walked over to the set of shelves it had rolled under he tried not to think about how long hed been in here he tried not to think about how long this was taking he squatted down and reached under the bottom shelf, trying to force his arm to grow as narrow as it could he felt years of cobwebs reluctantly give as he pushed deeper into the darkness a childhood fear of the unseen prickled at the back of his neck but he ignored it he would burn all these shadows away soon enough his fingertips gently kissed at the round edge of the tin and he grinned gotcha! he made a grab for it but ended up pushing it a little further out of his own reach son of a bitch! he punched the floor and cursed his hand stung from the impact his shoulder was starting to burn he squatted lower, tried reaching further a man had died for this tin as petty as it sounded that gave the thief licence to take it, along with everything else he could carry, before he burned this tomb to the ground let those two fat twins become ghosts let them wander the earth, unwanted and forgotten let them be left behind he would only speak words for his partner his friend maybe his last friend he strained again his shoulder threatening to separate his fingers stretching to the point of burgeoning agony they touched the edge of the tin again, briefly come on, he hissed come on! he grasped at it again the tin simply rolled away again and again he bellowed a curse his body shook with red hot frustration he wasnt thinking about the haul anymore he wasnt thinking about how long hed been in here or if anyone else was coming to investigate the shots let alone a customer no, he just wanted this one damn tin he had earned this one tin it was his, along with all the rest it was his property it was his right the world owed him this tin he wouldnt sell it, no matter what it was hed keep it a memorial to what had happened here today he splayed his body flat out over the floor he forced his tired arm deeper under the unit his shoulder begged for leniency, his fingers for mercy he could smell years of cheap bleach bleeding off the floor tiles pressed close to his face come to papa he closed his eyes he tried to force his whole body to move closer to the tin that was when he heard the shop door open and close behind him"
